🚀 My Dart Adventure

Hi there! 👋
I’m a designer by heart, but my curiosity for how things work behind the scenes led me to dive into the world of programming. 
🎨➡️💻 After working on countless interfaces and user experiences, I realized the value of speaking the language of code—and that’s when I picked up Dart. 
It’s been an exciting journey of combining my design knowledge with this powerful tool to bring ideas to life, both in appearance and functionality.

Here, you'll find some of my projects as I explore new ways to blend design and development. 
Feel free to take a look around, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to collaborate or chat about anything creative or code-related!
